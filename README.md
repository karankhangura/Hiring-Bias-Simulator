The Experiential Learning Center (ELC) in the Marshall School of Business is
devoted to running exercises related to undergraduate, graduate, and
executive education courses at USC. Periodically, instead of going to the
classroom, students will come to the ELC to participate in role plays,
simulations, games, etc., related to course concepts.
